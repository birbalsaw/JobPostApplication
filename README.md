Project 1: JobApp – Full-Stack Job Application Portal

Description:

JobApp is a full-stack web application designed to manage job postings and applications, featuring secure user authentication. The application enables users to register, log in, view job listings, create new job listings and manage applications.

Built with a modern tech stack — React for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend — the app ensures smooth user experience and reliable server-side performance. JWT-based authentication was implemented using Spring Security to maintain secure and stateless sessions. The backend exposes RESTful APIs, tested thoroughly using Postman, and persistent data is handled with PostgreSQL via Spring Data JPA.

Key Features:

Authentication (User registration, login)

JWT authentication for secure API communication

API testing with Postman

Persistent storage using PostgreSQL
